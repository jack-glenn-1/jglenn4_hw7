a. This project is html based with css formatting. It is a form containing 5 pages of basic questions regarding Tippie's Business Analaytics Program.
b. The web form I designed adheres to best practices for forms in several ways. Firstly, I ensured that the form has clear and descriptive labels for each input field, making it easy for users to understand what information is expected from them. This enhances usability and reduces confusion, which is crucial for improving the overall user experience. Additionally, I organized the form fields logically and used proper spacing and alignment to create a visually appealing layout. This helps users navigate the form more efficiently and encourages them to complete it.
Moreover, I incorporated input field validation to provide immediate feedback to users if they enter incorrect or incomplete information. This prevents errors and reduces frustration for users by guiding them through the form submission process. Additionally, I included error messages that clearly indicate what went wrong and how users can correct their mistakes, which further enhances the usability of the form.
c. In terms of accessibility, I made sure to use semantic HTML elements and provided alternative text for images to ensure compatibility with screen readers. I also implemented keyboard navigation and focus states for interactive elements, allowing users to navigate and interact with the form using only their keyboard. Furthermore, I ensured sufficient color contrast and avoided relying solely on color to convey information, making the form accessible to users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies. These accessibility features ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can easily interact with the form and complete their tasks effectively.
